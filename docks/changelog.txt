new in 1.2.
Made it so the emoji cleanup process runs automatically when the app starts. This keeps the emoji file organized without requiring manual editing by the user.
Added an emoji cleaning system to automatically fix issues in the emoji list. This system removes empty categories, duplicate category headers, and repeated or malformed emojis within each category. It also ensures all emojis are sorted alphabetically by category and label for consistency and readability.
Simplified the emoji system by removing the old web-based parsing logic and switching to a cleaner, human-readable plain text format. The app now directly loads emoji categories in the app without needing any additional conversion from the user.
Removed all of the skin tone emoji variations from the people & body category to streamline the emoji list and reduce clutter in the emoji menu.
Made it so the emoji menu shows the user how many emojies there are for each category of emojis while hovering over the item.
Resolved an issue where the displayed emoji names were sorted independently from their corresponding actual emoji characters, causing the wrong emoji to be copied. The system now sorts both the emoji names and characters together to ensure correct alignment and accurate clipboard copying.
new in 1.1
Added the ability to insert emoticons in your notes. There's now a button to brows through all available emojis by category. These are able to be copied to the clipboard for quick pasting into your current note.
Improved duplicate name detection when creating new notes. If a user attempts to create an untitled or custom titled note, and the file already exists, the app now displays a clear error message and aborts the creation.
Improved the readability of note names inside various alerts and dialogs. Whenever a note is opened, saved, renamed, or shown in info popups, the displayed note name no longer includes the full data/notes path. Instead, only the clean note name is shown, making alerts easier to read and more user-friendly.
Improved the note creation process. The app now asks the user if theyâ€™d like to create an untitled note when pressing the create Note button. If the user agrees, an empty untitled.txt file is created automatically. Otherwise, the user is prompted to enter a custom name for the note as before. This speeds up the process for jotting down quick notes.
Added the ability to delete written notes in the note editor.
Made it so opening a new note from within the note editor brings up a confermation prompt to save the note first before opening another one. This prevents accidental loss of work and ensures intentional switching of unopened notes.
Replaced the old Open File Dialog with a new and improved Menu-Based list of notes. The app now scans data/notes for all txt files and displays them in an easy to view list. This allows for more control over how notes are selected and opened in the main window, and the note editor.
Enhanced the close note dialog by replacing the original two-prompt confirmation system with a single streamlined menu. Users are now presented with a clear 3-option dialog for what to do with the written note. This improves usability, prevents accidental data loss, and keeps the workflow smooth and intuitive.
Made it so the function keys don't trigger actions related to the input box unless you're spisificly focused on the control.
The word count system has been fully removed due to inconsistent behavior and inaccurate results across various input scenarios.
new in 1.0
Resolved an issue where the line count would still show as 1 after all content had been deleted from a note. The get_note_stats function now accurately skips over empty or whitespace-filled lines.
Resolved an issue where the word count would incorrectly display as 1 even if the note was empty or only contained spaces. The get_note_stats function now properly trims and checks for real word content before attempting to count it.
Added the ability to view information for the currently opened note. You can now press the note info button in the note editor to view it's statistics, such as character count, word count, and line count.
Added menu prompts to actions that involve patencial data los in the app.

Added alt keyboard shortcuts to most frequently visited sections of the app.
Added the ability to rename notes in the note editor screen.
Resolved an issue where cycling keyboard themes using the F1 key could select incorrect themes due to the theme list being sorted after the index was incremented. The sorting is now applied before index changes, ensuring consistent theme order and proper selection.
Added a sound to indicate changing keyboard themes. This sound is available for all keyboard themes.
Fixed a bug where keyboard themes had problems showing up propperly upon launching the app. This also effected the F1 key to change them as well.
