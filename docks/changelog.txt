Added the ability to delete written notes in the note editor.
Made it so opening a new note from within the note editor brings up a confermation prompt to save the note first before opening another one. This prevents accidental loss of work and ensures intentional switching of unopened notes.
Replaced the old Open File Dialog with a new and improved Menu-Based list of notes. The app now scans data/notes for all txt files and displays them in an easy to view list. This allows for more control over how notes are selected and opened in the main window, and the note editor.
Enhanced the close note dialog by replacing the original two-prompt confirmation system with a single streamlined menu. Users are now presented with a clear 3-option dialog for what to do with the written note. This improves usability, prevents accidental data loss, and keeps the workflow smooth and intuitive.
Made it so the function keys don't trigger actions related to the input box unless you're spisificly focused on the control.
The word count system has been fully removed due to inconsistent behavior and inaccurate results across various input scenarios.
